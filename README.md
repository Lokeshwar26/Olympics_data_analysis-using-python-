# 🔍 **Olympics Data Analysis (1896 - 2016)** 🏅  

I recently completed a comprehensive data analysis project on the Olympics up to 2016. Using **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I uncovered some fascinating insights about the evolution of the Games.

## **Key Highlights:**  
- 🎖️ **Medals by Gender:** Significant growth in female participation and victories over the years.  
- 🌍 **Top 10 Medal-Winning Countries:** The USA, China, and Russia consistently leading the charts.  
- 🏋️ **Total Number of Sports:** Tracked the evolution and introduction of new sports.  
- 👥 **Athlete Participation:** Visualized the steady rise in athlete numbers with every event.  
- 📈 **Data Cleaning:** Efficiently cleaned and analyzed the dataset using **Pandas** for seamless processing.

## **Data Insights:**  
This project helped me sharpen my skills in **data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling** using Python libraries to create insightful and interactive visualizations.

### **Dataset Source:**  
[120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) from Kaggle.

💡 I'd love to connect with fellow data enthusiasts—what's your favorite Python library for data visualization?
